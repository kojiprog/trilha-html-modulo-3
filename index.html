        <h1 id="sobre">Série The Office</h1>
        <p>
          The Office is an American mockumentary sitcom television series that
          depicts the everyday work lives of office employees at the Scranton,
          Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. It
          aired on NBC from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, spanning a total of
          nine seasons.[1] Based on the 2001–2003 BBC series of the same name
          created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, it was adapted for
          American television by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for Saturday
          Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons. It was co-produced by
          Daniels' Deedle-Dee Productions and Reveille Productions (later Shine
          America), in association with Universal Television. The original
          executive producers were Daniels, Gervais, Merchant, Howard Klein, and
          Ben Silverman, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.

        <h3 id="temp1">Temporada 1 - 2005</h3>
        <p>
          The series starts by introducing Dunder Mifflin's employees via a tour
          given by branch manager Michael Scott for both a documentary camera
          crew and first-day temp Ryan Howard.[71] Salesman Jim Halpert has a
          crush on receptionist Pam Beesly, who helps him play pranks on
          co-worker Dwight Schrute, even though she is engaged to Roy Anderson,
          who works in the company's downstairs warehouse. Rumors spread
          throughout the office that Dunder Mifflin's corporate headquarters is
          planning to downsize an entire branch, leading to general anxiety.
          Still, Michael chooses to deny or downplay the realities of the
          situation to maintain employee morale.
        </p>
        <h3 id="temp2">Temporada 2 - 2005 ~ 2006</h3>
        <p>
          Many workers seen in the background of the first season are developed
          into secondary characters and romantic relationships begin to develop
          between some of them. Michael makes out with and then spends the night
          with his boss, Jan Levinson, but does not have sex with her.[72]
          Dwight and Angela become romantically involved,[73] but keep their
          relationship a secret. Kelly Kapoor develops a crush on Ryan, and they
          start dating off and on. When Roy finally agrees to set a date for his
          wedding to Pam,[74] at a company booze cruise, Jim grows depressed and
          considers transferring to the Stamford, Connecticut branch, but tells
          Pam in the season finale that he is in love with her. Even though Pam
          insists she is with Roy, the two kiss, and Jim transfers to the
          Stamford branch soon after.[75] The general threat of downsizing
          continues throughout the season as well.F
        </p>
        <h3 id="temp3">Temporada 3 - 2006 ~2007</h3>
        <p>
          The season starts with a brief flashback to (and additional footage
          from) the last episode of season two, "Casino Night", when Jim kissed
          Pam and confessed his feelings for her. Jim briefly transfers to
          Dunder Mifflin's Stamford branch after Pam confirms her commitment to
          Roy. Corporate is later forced to merge the Stamford branch with the
          Scranton branch.[76] Michael takes this merger very seriously.
          Transferred to the Scranton branch are saleswoman Karen Filippelli,
          whom Jim has begun dating, and the anger-prone preppy salesman Andy
          Bernard, along with other Stamford employees who all eventually quit
          within the first few episodes of being there. Pam is newly single
          after calling off her engagement to Roy, and Jim's unresolved feelings
          for her and his new relationship with Karen lead to shifting tensions
          between the three. Meanwhile, Michael and Jan's relationship
          escalates, which causes them to behave erratically on the job. On the
          other hand, Dwight and Angela continue their steamy secret
          relationship. In the season's finale, Jim, Karen, and Michael
          interview for a corporate position that turns out to be Jan's, who is
          fired for poor performance. Jim is offered the job but rejects it
          off-screen,[77] opting instead to remain in Scranton without Karen and
          ask Pam out on a date, which she joyfully accepts. In the final scene,
          we learn Ryan has been awarded Jan's job.[78]
        </p>
        <h3 id="temp4">Temporada 4 - 2007 ~2008</h3>
        <p>
          Karen has left the Scranton branch after her breakup with Jim and
          becomes the regional manager at the Utica branch.[81][82] A
          self-employed Jan moves herself and her candle business into Michael's
          condo, until the dissolution of their relationship midway through the
          season during an intimate dinner party including Pam, Jim, Andy,
          Angela and Dwight. After Dwight's crude (though well-intentioned)
          method of euthanasia of Angela's ailing cat without her
          permission,[83] she leaves him for Andy, leading Dwight into
          depression. Ryan, in his new corporate life in New York City, attempts
          to modernize Dunder Mifflin with a new website for online sales; he
          also learns that his boss, David Wallace, favors Jim, and thus Ryan
          attempts to sabotage Jim's career. Ryan is soon arrested and fired for
          misleading the shareholders and committing fraud related to the
          website's sales numbers. Toby announces he is moving to Costa Rica and
          is replaced by Holly Flax, who quickly shows a liking for Michael. Pam
          decides to follow her artistic interests and is accepted to attend a
          three-month graphic design course at the Pratt Institute in New York
          City. In the season finale, Jim almost proposes to Pam but is
          interrupted by Andy proposing to Angela, who reluctantly agrees.
          Phyllis then catches Dwight and Angela having sex in the office.[84]

        <h2 id="prod_place">Product placement</h2>
        <p>
          The Office has had product placement deals with Staples[99] and
          Olympic balers,[100] as well as mentioning in dialogue or displaying
          clear logos for products such as Sandals Resorts, HP, Apple, and
          Gateway computers, and Activision's Call of Duty video game series. In
          certain versions of "The Merger", Kevin Malone uses a Staples-branded
          shredding machine to shred a Staples-branded CD-R and many other
          nonpaper items, including a salad.[99] Cisco Systems, a supplier of
          networking and telephone equipment, paid for product placement, which
          can be seen on close-up shots of the Cisco IP telephones. Some
          products have additional branding labels attached; this can be clearly
          seen with the HP photo printer on Toby's desk in season 6, and less
          noticeably with the Cisco phones.[101] In "The Secret" Michael takes
          Jim to Hooters[102] to discuss Jim's feelings for Pam.
        </p>

          Many products featured are not part of product placement agreements,
          but rather inserted by writers as products the characters would use to
          create realism under the guise of a documentary. Chili's restaurants
          were used for filming in "The Dundies" and "The Client", as the
          writers believed they were realistic choices for a company party and
          business lunch.[103][104][105] Though not an explicit product
          placement, the producers of the show had to allow Chili's to have
          final approval of the script before filming, causing a scene of "The
          Dundies" to be hastily rewritten when the chain objected to the
          original version.[104] Wegmans, a supermarket chain based out of
          Rochester, New York has had a working relationship with the show since
          fall of 2007. Wegmans cereal, popcorn and cans of Wegmans soda have
          discreetly popped up in many episodes since then.[106] Apple Inc.
          received over four minutes of publicity for the iPod when it was used
          as a much-desired gift in "Christmas Party", though the company did
          not pay for the placement.[107] The travel website TripAdvisor was
          featured during Season 4 when after a visit to Dwight's "agritourism"
          bed and breakfast, Schrute Farms, Jim and Pam post an online review
          about their stay. The show reportedly approached the travel review
          website about using their name on the show and TripAdvisor set up a
          review page for the fictional B&B, which itself received hundreds of
          reviews.[108] The appearance of Second Life in the episode "Local Ad"
          was rated eighth in the top ten most effective product placements of
          2007.[109]
